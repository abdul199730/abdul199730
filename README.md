# Hi, I’m Abdul Majid

> Spring Boot microservice developer building resilient, observable, and scalable backend systems. I focus on reliability, performance, and developer experience for cloud-native applications.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: a high-throughput Spring Boot microservice platform for e-commerce & payments
- 🌱 I’m learning: advanced distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry), performance tuning, and reactive Spring
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: event-driven systems, platform automation, and developer experience tooling
- 💬 Ask me about: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, system design
- ⚡ Fun fact: I automate repetitive ops with small Spring Boot apps and cron jobs ☕️

## 🚀 Featured Projects
> Pin 3–6 repos from your profile using the "Pinned" feature on your GitHub profile page. Choose repos that show production readiness, tests, docs and CI.

- [order-service](https://github.com/abdul199730/order-service) — Spring Boot microservice for order processing with Kafka-based eventing, PostgreSQL, integration tests, and CI.
- [microservice-starter](https://github.com/abdul199730/microservice-starter) — Opinionated Spring Boot starter: auth, health checks, metrics, structured logging, and observability.
- [infra-automation](https://github.com/abdul199730/infra-automation) — Terraform + Helm charts and deployment pipelines for staging/production Kubernetes clusters.

(Replace the links above with your real repos or create these skeleton repos and link them here.)

## 📦 Typical repo layout I follow
- /src/main/java & /src/test/java (Spring Boot)
- Dockerfile + image build pipeline
- helm/ or k8s/ for deployment manifests
- docs/ and architecture/ with diagrams and quickstarts
- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE and .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE
- CI: GitHub Actions workflows for build/test/lint/deploy

## How to collaborate
- Open issues/feature requests on the repo you want to contribute to
- Add a small reproducible example for bug reports
- Follow CONTRIBUTING.md in each repo (I try to respond to issues/PRs within ~48 hours)

---

## Good practices I follow
- Clear README with quickstart, sample requests, and health endpoints
- Tests + CI (unit, integration, contract tests) for each service
- Structured logging, metrics, tracing and health checks
- Semantic commit messages (Conventional Commits)
- Labels and issue templates for triage and prioritization
- Automated dependency updates (Dependabot / Renovate)

If you'd like, I can:
- replace project placeholders with your actual repos and write short blurbs,
- generate CONTRIBUTING.md, ISSUE and PR templates,
- create starter templates (Spring Boot + OpenTelemetry + metrics) for your microservices.
